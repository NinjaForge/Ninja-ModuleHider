MODULE DESCRIPTION=<h2>Ninja Modulehider 2.2.3</h2> <p>Ninja Modulehider allows you to bundle modules into one position, making them look like a single module, and then enclose them in a panel that can then be opened and closed, hiding the contained modules.</p>

INCL MOO=Include mootools script?
INCL MOO DESC=If you already have a mootools script (with the slide functions included) or this is the second or subsequent modulehider, set this to no.

USE COOKIE=Remember open status
USE COOKIE DESC=Do you wish for the modulehider to remember if it was opened or not by a visitor and use that status, or to always start the page open orclosed?

INITIAL STATE=Initial State
INITIAL STATE DESC=What would you like the initial state to be for the modulehider, open or closed? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If &lt;em&gt;Remember Open Status&lt;/em&gt; is set to yes, then this may be ignored after a visitor changes the state of the modulehider themselves.
OPEN=Open
CLOSED=Closed

INCL CSS=Include CSS File
INCL CSS DESC=If you wish to write your own css and add it to your site template css files then set this to no.

MOD SUFFIX=Module Class Suffix
MOD SUFFIX DESC= A suffix that is appended to the class of this module. This allows individual module styling. Leave this as it is if you want this module (not the staging modules) to appear invisible. If this is blank, then you will see the modules wrapped inside each other, in which case give the inside modules a suffix of -flush to hide their styling.

MOD IDS=Module IDs
MOD IDS DESC=A comma separated list of module ids that you want to display in the modulizer

CLOSE MESSAGE=Close Message
CLOSE MESSAGE DESC=Message to display on the handle when the panel is open.
OPEN MESSAGE=Open Message
OPEN MESSAGE DESC=Message to display on the handle when the panel is closed.

HANDLE LOC=Handle location
HANDLE LOC DESC=Where should the message, which is the open and close handle, be displayed.
HANDLE LOC ABOVE=Above the panel
HANDLE LOC BELOW=Below the panel

USE LANG=Use language files for Message?
USE LANG DESC=Do you wish to use the module language files for the handle message instead of the parameters. This is really only important for multiple language sites, as this module will then change it's language to suit the visitor.

MOD LAYOUT=Module Chrome
MOD LAYOUT DESC=What style of module chrome do you want to use when displaying your modules? This only affects the contained modules, not the outer Modulehider module, which is decided by the template and module position you are using.

RAW=None/Raw, no surrounding HTML, for merging module appearances
XHTML=XHTML, one div for simple styling
ROUNDED=Rounded Corners, four nested divs
TABLE=Table, placed in a table for fixed positioning
HORZ=Horizontal, placed in a table for horizontal layout
OUTLINE=Outline, for debugging
CUSTOM=Custom, enter below (must exist in your template)

CUSTOM CHROME=Custom Chrome
CUSTOM CHROME DESC=If your template includes custom module chrome, you can enter it here. (must select custom from the list above)
